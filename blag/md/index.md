# Welcome to unmon.js

```
Said Ummon to his disciples,
  "However wonderful a thing is,
   it may be that it is better
   not to have it at all."
```

## Simplicity

At this point, most people think that means simple _for them_. Making things simple for an uneducated user means building something huge and complex which does everything the could ever want. Unmon doesn't do that.

Instead, Unmon does things in a simple enough fashion that you can learn how it works and reconfigure it (with a little work). 

## No SQL

I don't mean it uses a noSQL database. I mean it uses the filesystem. That means you don't need to log in through some interface, or create tables in a database. Just edit files.

## Content

You don't even really have to know HTML. Unmon comes with a simple template. Just write some [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and it will swap the content into the template.

The links in the sidebar are generated from a JSON file located (by default) in `./blag/static/nav.json`.
