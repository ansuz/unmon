'Said Ummon to his disciples,
 "However wonderful a thing is,
 it may be that it is better
 not to have it at all."
```

## Introducing [unmon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunmen_Wenyan)!

**unmon** is a very thin wrapper around the NodeJS HTTP API.

```text
A monk once asked Ummon,
  "What is this place where knowledge is useless?"
Ummon answered him: 
  "Knowledge and emotion cannot fathom it!"
```

**unmon** is premised upon **Hoare's Law of Large Programs**:

> "Inside every large program is a small program struggling to get out"


## Installation

```Bash
# clone via git
git clone https://github.com/ansuz/unmon

# navigate into your new unmon directory
cd unmon

# install ansuzjs via npm
npm install ansuz
```

Otherwise:

* You don't need to install a database
* You don't need to remember any new passwords


## Just launch it

```Bash
node unmon.js
```

To daemonize unmon and run it in the background:

```Bash
# install 'forever' via npm
sudo npm install forever -g

# and launch it
forever start unmon.js
```

## Then what?


1. Browse to http://localhost:8083 and check out your server's content
2. Customize your server or its content to suit your needs


```text
Monk: "What is the one road of Ummon?"
Ummon: "Personal Experience!"
Monk: "What is the Way?"
Ummon: "Go!"
Monk: "What is the road, where is the Way?"
Ummon: "Begin walking it!"
```
