'Said Ummon to his disciples,
 "However wonderful a thing is,
 it may be that it is better
 not to have it at all."
```

Introducing [unmon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunmen_Wenyan)!

**unmon** is a minimalist blogging framework.

```text
A monk once asked Ummon,
  "What is this place where knowledge is useless?"
Ummon answered him: 
  "Knowledge and emotion cannot fathom it!"
```

**unmon** only depends on the nodejs runtime. 

That means:

* You don't need any external js modules
* You don't need to install a database
* You don't need to remember any new passwords

Monk: "What is the one road of Ummon?"
Ummon: "Personal Experience!"
Monk: "What is the Way?"
Ummon: "Go!"
Monk: "What is the road, where is the Way?"
Ummon: "Begin walking it!"
```

The central philosophy behind **unmon** is that software should simplify repetitive tasks without obfuscating their details.
